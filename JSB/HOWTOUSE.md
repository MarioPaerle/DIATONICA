# HOW TO USE JsbFetcher.py

if intomido is totally working then it's easy:
1. change the tipo=... to 'train' or 'test'
2. write a name
3. launch the file, then press enter as the "save >>>  " shows up and wait
4. a .pkl file will be generated into the datas folder, to load it just use joblib.load(PATH)
5. of course, it's recommended to generate both train and test :P
