# DIATONICA
A small framework to easily work with MIDI files, and to "easily" create datasets starting from midi files

I'll also probably include my Music Models sketching.

## Requirements
- numpy
- scipy
- mido (to use messages and composers files)
- pypianoroll (functions)
- matplotlib (functions)
