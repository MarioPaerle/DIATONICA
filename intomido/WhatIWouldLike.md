# What I would like to be able to do is:
### Programming music, with freedom, and lot of priors, with code like:

piano = Instrument()

progression = random_progression()

progression.style('trap')

melody = generate_melody(progression, t=t, ...)

### We could just rethink the performance as an ensemble of 1d signals
- For example the Tempo signal could be used as a performance signal, as i walways do in fl studio to reproduce a human played piano experience
- Same thing could be done for melodies for what regardas velocities, which with jazz can be just casted as a random signal for example
- Another example could be filters in electronic music, but also expression, vibrato tremolo ecc.
- We don't need AI for this, most of this things could be programmed as oscillatory signals + random noise.
- I COULD CAST TO SCALE THE DICRETE DIFF GENERATIONS!
